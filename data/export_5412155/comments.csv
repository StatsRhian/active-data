"11 Jul 2014, 23:51:18",NOM! Totally worth the sunburn. 
"17 Jul 2014, 22:14:42",Cram it in end of August then :)
"18 Jul 2014, 11:42:54",if you had a sexy folding bike you could take it with you ;)
"18 Jul 2014, 14:31:18",Not a run. Either bike ride or accidental car. 
"23 Jul 2014, 10:13:12",Great climbing skillz
"22 Aug 2014, 23:45:46",Did you intentionally map out a wonky triskelion?
"31 Aug 2014, 18:58:55",Oooh! Jealous!
"12 Sep 2014, 14:47:50","""PR on PhycoPath (6:32)"" Excellent segment name."
"12 Jan 2015, 15:33:08",changepoints!
"10 Apr 2015, 18:32:36",It's about time ;)

"17 May 2015, 09:36:27",Pudding house? Good call :)
"26 May 2015, 20:28:53","The Ship? I've never made it that far, always get distracted by The Albion in Arnside... Good beer?"
"31 May 2015, 16:43:30",Good work :) More training than I'm doing! 
"2 Jun 2015, 22:21:25",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvMQWte5pik :)
"4 Jun 2015, 22:25:53",Found some good viewing spots so I can throw things and laugh?
"12 Jul 2015, 15:08:52",Pudding house?
"21 Jul 2015, 10:07:06",Contains a large incorrect section
"5 Aug 2015, 10:31:35",Feeling the need to re-watch The Matrix now :)
"16 Aug 2015, 15:51:59","Nice!
"
"14 Sep 2015, 09:36:07","My Garmin barometric altimeter isn't temperature compensated, so when I stop it does silly things. It should look a bit more sensible now, although cliff diving with a bike does sound quite fun..."
"20 Sep 2015, 08:24:54",Yay!
"23 Sep 2015, 21:16:12",Yay!!!
"19 Oct 2015, 13:08:12",146k/h pretty good ;)
"1 Jan 2016, 16:46:18","Looked at segments. Highly likely this is a bike ride, not a run."
"1 Jan 2016, 16:48:04",Not a run.
"25 Feb 2016, 14:35:56",Birthday ride! Glad to see you've dusted off the bike ;)

"28 Jun 2016, 02:07:51", Parkrun? http://www.parkrun.org.uk/march/
"2 Aug 2016, 14:27:00",Jealous!
"9 Aug 2016, 15:40:42",Your world should always be hilly :)
"20 Aug 2016, 15:47:07",I did consider jumping into the canal on the way back -  wouldn't have made a difference to my soggyness.
"29 Aug 2016, 08:48:10","Pace jumps from 9:40km to 1:50km at the ends of the run, resulting in a CR which I believe is incorrect. (female CR 1 minute faster than male CR)"
"18 Sep 2016, 14:54:50",Yeah lovely. Not too cold and fabulous views. Cut short by having to jump out and wave at James part way around his race. 
"20 Sep 2016, 19:18:22",Pretty!
"26 Sep 2016, 13:06:43",Prestigio!
"29 Sep 2016, 08:36:53","But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep."
"16 Dec 2016, 12:59:55",Part of activity was in a vehicle
"24 Dec 2016, 15:27:59",She's a blast. 
"16 Jan 2017, 10:53:54","Mud. I'd have no chance on ice!

"26 May 2018, 23:35:23","Yes it was super hot today. I missed you too, probably because I was hiding at the back! Great run Sarah :) xx"
"31 May 2018, 20:02:47",Difficult journey back? :(
"2 Jun 2018, 16:12:14",There are sights to see in Wolverhampton?
"3 Jun 2018, 15:02:45",A great week!👏 🏃‍♀️
"12 Jun 2018, 21:05:52",A nice mix between currents and smooth water. Varies between very shallow sections and sudden deep pools. Especially shallow this evening though!
"16 Jun 2018, 05:54:43",Pistachio and Christmas pudding. Classic!

"18 Feb 2019, 13:14:27","I did that route once and got very lost. However, it was very dark and I was without a head torch so maybe that's why...  Lovely route :)"
"24 May 2019, 16:28:28",That's a long way to go for a couple of tiles ;)
"26 May 2019, 19:57:23",Cute!
